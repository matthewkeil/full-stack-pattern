# Getting Started

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Golden Rule

The golden rule is, if you don't have to build it, there is nothing to debug.

There is a ton of great work in this repo and a lot of testing has gone into making sure these constructs are bulletproof. Lean on that guidance and use the existing constructs. They should be fully extensible. If you find, however, that one of the constructs in this repo is insufficient feel free to modify it and submit a PR to make everyone that uses it behind you a happy dev. See how happy you are by not having to code all this stuff... just think of all the smiling faces when git blame says you were the right person for the job.
